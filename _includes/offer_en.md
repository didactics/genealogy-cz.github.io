I offer a trace of records from the registries of births, deaths, and divorces in the Czech Republic, and their processing to build a family tree to your liking (e.g. pedigree by the direct paternal or maternal line, building the ascending or descending family tree from an entry person).

The ready family tree will be available electronically via e-mail or on a CD with installation instructions for the free [MyHeritage](https://www.myheritage.com){:target="_blank"} software, where you can edit the tree --- even in the free version it is possible to make a large variety of chart types with lots of graphical options available.

Each found record will be photographed and attached in the BMP format to the final family tree.

You will also receive a basic family tree in the PDF format, ready for printing.
