I offer a trace of records from the registries of births, deaths, and marriages in the Czech Republic, and their processing to build a family tree to your liking (e.g. pedigree by the direct paternal or maternal line, building the ascending or descending family tree from an entry person).

Your finished family tree is available in digital form through email or on a Compact Disk. You also receive instructions on how to View, Edit and Print your family tree using the free version of [MyHeritage](https://www.myheritage.com/family-tree-builder){:target="_blank"} software. The free version of [MyHeritage](https://www.myheritage.com/family-tree-builder){:target="_blank"} can print your family tree in a wide variety of chart types and with lots of graphical options.

Each found record will be photographed and attached in the BMP format to the final family tree.

You will also receive a basic family tree in the PDF format, ready for printing.
