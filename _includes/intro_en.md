If your heart is turned to your ancestors and seeks for your roots --- you've come to the right place here.

I can help you find out who your ancestors were, where they were born, whom they married, how many children they had, what they have been, and how they died.

Our ancestors deserve our attention --- we may have inherited their attributes, and most importantly --- without them we wouldn't 've been here.

Looking forward to collaboration with you,

Simona Danielova
