None of my genealogical services is possible without your input.

To find members of your family and build your family tree, it is necessary to start with as much information as possible about your ancestors.  It helps to have names used  (including maiden names and nick names), date of birth or marriage. It is helpful to know places of birth, marriage or death.  The names of parents, siblings and children can often improve speed up the search. 

The best source of this information is the documents available to you --- the birth certificate of the person or its children, e.g. marriage, death certificate, obituary or other documents.
