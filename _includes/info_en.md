None of my genealogical services is possible without your input.

To find your families ancestors and build your family tree, it is best to start with a person born before 1916.  Knowing the birthdate and place, marriage information, death records about your starting person increases the chances for a rewarding search.

The best source of this information is the documents available to you --- the birth certificate of the person or its children, e.g. marriage, death certificate, obituary or other documents.
