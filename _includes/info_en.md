None of my genealogical services is possible without your input.

To build the family tree it is necessary to obtain information about the entry person (preferably the date of birth or marriage) if he/she was born more than 100 years ago --- i.e. before the year 1915.

The best source of this information is the documents available to you --- the birth certificate of the person or its children, e.g. marriage, death certificate, obituary or other documents.
