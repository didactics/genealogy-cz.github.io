Total price of the family tree depends on the amount of information you would like to know about each person.

There are three types of records:
    
* date and place of birth (birth registries)

* date and place of marriage (registry of marriages)

* date and place of death (registry of deaths)


1 record = $5.00

1 record of a sibling's birth = $3.00

The basic data is the birth and marriage.

During the compilation of the family tree you will be kept informed of the price and the amount of information your family tree contains to date. You will decide how much to invest to your family tree.

Hint: the indicative price of building a subtree from the entry person up to the fifth generation (15 couples) would be around 4 500 Kƒç (CZE, Czech Crowns).
